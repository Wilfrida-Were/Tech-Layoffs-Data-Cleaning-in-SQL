# 📊 Tech Layoffs 2020–2024

## Project Goal: Workforce Risk Analysis for Strategic Planning

This project analyzes global tech layoffs from 2020–2024 to uncover patterns across companies, industries, and countries. It’s designed for **HR teams, workforce planners, investors, and policy makers** who need fast, data-driven insights to guide hiring, scaling, and reskilling decisions.

Whether you're planning headcount, evaluating sector risk, or designing support programs, this analysis helps you act with clarity and confidence.

I used **SQL (SQLite3)** for data cleaning and trend analysis, and built an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to visualize layoffs by geography, industry, and company.

> *Disclaimer: This dataset is compiled from public sources and may not reflect all global layoffs. It’s intended for exploratory analysis and strategic pattern recognition—not for forecasting or operational decisions.*

## Business Impact Summary

- Identified high-risk sectors and regions for workforce disruption  
- Revealed layoff timing trends to inform hiring and investment cycles  
- Delivered role-specific recommendations for strategic planning

## ✅ Recommendations

**For HR & Workforce Planners**  
- Avoid aggressive hiring in volatile sectors like Retail and Consumer Tech.  
- Prioritize reskilling programs in regions hit hardest (e.g. USA, India).  
- Use layoff timing trends to guide headcount planning and contract renewals.

**For Investors & Analysts**  
- Reassess exposure to companies with repeated or large-scale layoffs (e.g. Amazon, Meta).  
- Diversify into industries with lower layoff rates like Finance or Hardware.  
- Monitor startup risk—100% layoffs signal fragility in early-stage ventures.

**For Founders & Business Leaders**  
- Use industry-level layoff data to inform conservative hiring and flexible staffing.  
- Benchmark against peers to assess operational resilience.  
- Prepare contingency plans for sectors with high churn.

**For Policy Makers & NGOs**  
- Target workforce support in countries with high layoff volumes (USA, India).  
- Design training programs for displaced workers in Retail and Consumer Tech.  
- Track startup closures to inform entrepreneurship support policies.

## 🧩 Client Scenario: Applying the Recommendations

Let’s say you’re an **HR Director at a global tech firm** planning 2024 hiring and retention strategy.

### 🎯 Goal: Reduce Workforce Risk in Volatile Sectors

- Review layoff trends by industry—Retail and Consumer Tech show highest churn  
- Pause hiring in those sectors; shift focus to stable areas like Finance and Hardware  
- Launch internal reskilling programs for roles vulnerable to disruption  
- Use Tableau dashboard to present layoff timing trends to leadership

**Why it works:**  
This approach helps avoid over-hiring in unstable sectors, supports employee retention, and builds resilience through proactive planning.


### 💼 Goal: Advise Leadership on Strategic Talent Allocation

- Highlight peak layoff year (2023) and sharp decline in 2024  
- Show country-level impact—USA and India are most affected  
- Recommend flexible staffing models and regional hiring adjustments  
- Use company-level data to benchmark against competitors

**Why it works:**  
Grounding decisions in macro-level data builds trust and credibility. It helps leadership align talent strategy with market realities.
