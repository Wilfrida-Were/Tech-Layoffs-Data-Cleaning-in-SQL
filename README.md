# 📊 Tech Layoffs 2020–2024

## Project Goal
This project analyzes global tech layoffs from 2020–2024, uncovering trends across companies, industries, and countries to provide actionable insights for business leaders, investors, and policy makers.

I used **SQL (SQLite3)** for cleaning and analysis, and built an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to uncover trends across companies, industries, and countries.  

For those who want to explore the full code, data cleaning, and analysis workflow, you can view the complete **Kaggle Notebook** here:

## ✅ Quick Recommendations

- **For Job Seekers:** Focus on industries that have shown relative stability, such as **Finance and Hardware**. Understanding which sectors are less affected by layoffs can help you target applications more strategically and avoid volatile sectors 
- **For Investors:** Be cautious with **Consumer and Retail** tech sectors, which have seen higher layoffs. Consider diversifying your investments across more stable industries to reduce exposure to market volatility.  
- **For Founders:** Use industry-wide layoff trends to **inform hiring and scaling decisions**. In sectors with high layoffs, consider conservative hiring strategies, flexible staffing, or scenario planning to mitigate business risk.  
- **For Policy Makers:** Target **reskilling and workforce support programs** in regions most affected by layoffs. Those regions could benefit from training programs in emerging or stable sectors to improve employment outcomes.
